# Next steps:

- [ ] Embed image files into pdf instead of keeping them as links.
- [ ] Replacing the Jsonparser function with the JSDOM framework.
- [ ] Increasing the readability of the code


# Usage

I haven't designed an interface yet.

The project was built using nodejs. You can start it with `node main.js`

Before starting, you must replace the link in -- with your own song.

```js
var preload_state = await Api.GetGeniusBody("https://genius.com/Sanser-susamam-lyrics")
```
